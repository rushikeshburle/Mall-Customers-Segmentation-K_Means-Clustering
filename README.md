# Mall-Customers-Segmentation-K_Means-Clustering
The Mall Customers Segmentation project aims to analyze and segment customers based on their shopping behavior using the K-Means clustering algorithm. In today's competitive retail environment, understanding customer segments is crucial for targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

The dataset used in this project typically includes features such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score. These features are utilized to group customers into distinct clusters, allowing for the identification of similarities and differences among them.

The K-Means clustering algorithm is chosen for its simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness in partitioning data into clusters. It iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid based on their similarity, aiming to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares.
